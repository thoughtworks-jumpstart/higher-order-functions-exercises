# Assignment: Higher order functions

## Setup

- `npm install`
- To run all tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
- To run a specific test suite: `npm run test:watch ./[directory]`
  - For example: `npm run test:watch ./map`

Instructions can be found in the javascript files. Read the test file to get more context on what you need to do in order to pass the tests.

All the tests are skipped initially. Remove the `.skip` in the test cases to enable the test cases one by one. Make one test case pass before moving on to another one.
